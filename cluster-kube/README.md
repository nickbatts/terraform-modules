# Terraform Module - Elastic Kubernetes Cluster (EKS)
This terraform module creates an Elastic Kubernetes Cluster (EKS) on AWS. It deploys nodes into a public subnet in each availability zone with an Amazon managed Kubernetes master control plane.

## Terraform Variables
The `cluster-kube` module requires 5 variables to be defined in the `variables.tf` file, these variables are defined below

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| asg_desired_count | How many instances would you like in the ASG? | string | `6` | yes |
| cluster_name | Name of the Elastic Kubernetes Cluster | string | `TEST` | yes |
| instance_type | EC2 instance type to use for cluster instances - default: t2.micro | string | `t2.micro` | yes |
| region | AWS region to create kubernetes cluster in | string | `us-east-1` | yes |
| spot_price | If set, ASG will use spot instances with this variable as max bid price. | string | `` | no |

## Usage
```hcl
module "kubernetes" {
  source = "github.com/nickbatts/terraform-modules//cluster-kube"

  asg_desired_count = "${var.asg_desired_count}"
  cluster_name      = "${var.cluster_name}"
  instance_type     = "${var.instance_type}"
  region            = "${var.region}"
  spot_price        = "${var.spot_price}"
}
```

## Outputs
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| config-map-aws-auth | Kubernetes configuration file to authorize nodes to join cluster |
| kubeconfig | kubeconfig ready to be saved to ~/.kube/config to interact with cluster |
- Save the kubeconfig configuration into default location, e.g. `~/.kube/config`
- Save the aws-auth configuration into a file, e.g. `config-map-aws-auth.yaml`
- Run  `kubectl apply -f config-map-aws-auth.yaml`
- Verify the worker nodes are joining the cluster via: `kubectl get nodes --watch`
